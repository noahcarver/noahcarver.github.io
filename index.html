				<p>Most modern day teenagers play video games. Some do it has a hobby and others want to make a living off of it. I want to program video games. Even if I can't get a job at big companies like Ubisoft or 343 Industries, I still want to do it. I'm very creative. When I listen to music, I create worlds in my head. I can create stories and characters just by listening to music. My interest in mythology also helps boost the worlds I create. Indie-games are a starting point to many creators that are just beginning. They help get your name as a creator out there. Mythology plays a big part in helping me because so many things use mythological deities and creatures in their stories. People like Bill Gates inspire me to work hard to achieve my goals. Bill Gates started from nothing and is now one of the richest people on the plant. His story helps me grow and strive to do better.</p>
