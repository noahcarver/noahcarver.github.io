				<p>C.I.T. was a great class. I learned all the ins-and-outs of a computer and how to repair them. One project in particular helped me strengthen my ability to work fast and manage small parts. I had one day to take it apart and one day to put it back together. I had to make sure I was being safe but fast at the same time. Computer's have tiny screws, chips, and wires. I made sure to keep the pieces that went together stayed together. I tore down and put back together the computer almost perfectly. The only thing I messed up was the fan. Even though I messed up I learned from my mistake. A couple months later we had to take apart a laptop and re-assemble it. This time I did it flawlessly. Not a single mistake was made. I kept track of everything from screws to chips. Of course I did not do it with out the help of my classmates. I asked for help and watched them take it apart or put it back together. Watching them was not considering cheating because I then had to go back and do it myself. It was just a helpful visual. C.I.T. was one of the most influential classes on my life as a hole. </p>
