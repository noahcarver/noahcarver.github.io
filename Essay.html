				<p>The essay on Japanese Mythology taught me how to research difficult topics and excel at understanding foreign cultures. Reading about the Gods and Goddesses that people thought created the world is always a fascinating topic. But this topic is sometimes difficult to understand. The things these deities do may be a little confusing if it is not directly stated in there name. You need to develop the skill of finding context clues to help you figure out why this deity is so important to their mythology and its respective culture. By finding context clues and marking the text I was able to better understand and appreciate different cultures. Some people may wonder how mythology is involved in the world today. Video games take a lot from mythology. Some make up there own mythology and world while others use our real world myths and legends to help create their world. One example of this would be the Game series God of War. In it you play a fictional character who fights his way through Greek gods and creatures to become a god. Mythology helps inspire me to create colorful worlds and characters for stories I write that will one day become my very own video game. </p>
