				<p>Programming is teaching me to understand how a computer "thinks". By using programs like Alice and Net Beans, I learn about how computers "think" and take commands. Just by doing a fun little story about a skeleton and a yeti baby, I learned that computers are smart. That may sound like a stupid statement at first. You must put in the command perfectly because if you mess up, the computer still does the command. But it does it wrong. Programming also helps me learn how to make animations. I want to design video games when I graduate from school. This class helps me learn the basics. Next semester I will be in Programming 2. This class will help further me to my goal to become a game designer. Not everyone starts in big game companies. Some people start small and then advance from there. Programming one may be the basics and some advanced procedures but its a step in the right direction to becoming a video game programmer. </p>
